This verilog code is for 7-segment implementation in FPGA.

You can use this code as skeleton code.
But you can't just run this code and see what you want because each fpga has a different port, so you have to set it up yourself.

"4num_infinite_repetition" is a code that expresses four desired numbers in fpga in infinite repetition.
The number 125 in fpga has to be printed very quickly and repeatedly with the number 1, 2, 5.
So it will be helpful to study "clock" in verilog.
